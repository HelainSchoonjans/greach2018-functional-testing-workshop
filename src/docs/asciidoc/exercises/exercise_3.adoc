== Testing the show

In the previous exercise, we used the GET HTTP method on the '/products' url resulting in a listing of the existing products.

If we want to get only a single product from the API, we would use the '/products/:productId' endpoint instead.

== Exercise 3

Copy the following two tests in you test suite, to test the /products/:productId endpoint.

[source,groovy]
----
    def "It can get an existing product"() {
        given: 'a product'
        def product = new Product(name: 'product', price: 10)
        Product.withNewSession {
            product.save(flush: true, failOnError: true)
        }

        when: 'getting the product from the api'
        def response = restBuilder.get baseUrl + "/products/${product.id}"

        then: 'it returns a OK status code'
        false // TODO expression evaluating to true if the response status is 200, to false otherwise

        and: 'the json response contains the product information'
        false // TODO store the json of the response in a variable
        false // TODO expression that will evaluate to true only if the attribute 'name' of the json is 'product'
        false // TODO expression that will evaluate to true only if the attribute 'price' of the json is 10
    }

    def "It can't get a non-existing product"() {
        when: 'getting the product from the api'
        def response = restBuilder.get baseUrl + "/products/1234"

        then: 'it doesn\'t return a OK status code'
        false // TODO expression evaluating to true if the response status is 404, to false otherwise
    }
----

These tests are failing since they contain `false` expressions in the `then` block. Make it succeed by replacing the 'false' by expressions like hinted by the TODOs.
